# The Beak of Finches
Evolutionary biologists Rosemary and Peter Grant spent four decades tracking changes in body traits directly tied to survival in the famous Galápagos finches. 
# Key concepts
Individuals in a population have different variations of heritable traits.
In a given environment, individuals with one variation of a trait may be more likely to survive and reproduce than individuals without that variation.
The frequency of advantageous, heritable variations will increase in the population over successive
generations. This is known as evolution by natural selection.
Graphing and statistics can be used to summarize data, examine variability in data, and more readily identify patterns in data.
# Clarifications and Caveats
The data set is a small random sample of the data collected by biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant. It contains morphological measurements of 100 medium ground finches born between 1973 and 1976 on the island of Daphne Major in the Galápagos.
The data set includes data on males, females, and birds of undetermined sex. The third category was included because young male finches often look like females and may not have typical male plumage for a year or more.
